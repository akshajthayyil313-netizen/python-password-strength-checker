Password Strength Checker – Python Project

This project is a Python-based Password Strength Checker designed to validate and rate the security level of user-entered passwords. It checks a password against essential security criteria by verifying its length, structure, and character composition. The tool runs in an interactive loop, giving immediate feedback and guiding users toward creating stronger, more secure passwords.

Key Features

Minimum Length Validation
Ensures the password contains at least 8 characters.

Character Type Detection
Checks for the presence of digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.

Regex-Based Special Character Check
Uses Python’s re module to detect special symbols.

Password Strength Classification
Categorizes input as Weak, Medium, or Strong based on missing conditions.

Interactive CLI Interface
Simple command-line tool that runs continuously until the user types exit.
