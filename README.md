This project is a Python-based **Password Strength Checker** that validates user-entered passwords against essential security rules. It checks for minimum length, numeric characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and the presence of special characters. The tool runs in a loop, providing real-time feedback until the user exits.

### **Key Features**

* Validates password length (minimum 8 characters).
* Checks for numeric, uppercase, and lowercase characters.
* Detects special characters using regular expressions.
* Provides strength classification: Weak, Medium, Strong.
* Simple, interactive command-line interface.

### **Tech Stack**

* Python 3
* Regular Expressions (re module)

### **Use Cases**

* Learning Python conditionals and loops
* Understanding regex for text validation
* Beginner cybersecurity concepts
* Portfolio project for data/automation learners

### **How to Run**

```bash
python password_checker.py
```

### **Future Enhancements (Optional Section)**

* Add color-based output (green/yellow/red)
* Export password checks to a CSV or log file
* Build a GUI using Tkinter or a web UI using Flask
